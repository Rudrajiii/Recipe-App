    1) If the input is not related to food or recipes, return the following JSON:
    {

    2) JSON object will allways be in 3 backtick json and in end 3 backtick so the json object can be highlighted as well.
    3) If the input is food-related , Generate a detailed nutritional analysis for the given dish or recipe in the following JSON format make sure  use exact key names and structure:
    {
    "calories": "Total Calories in kcal (e.g., '200 kcal')",
    "macronutrients": {
        "protein": { "amount": "Protein amount in grams (e.g., '10 g')", "percent_dv": "Percent Daily Value (e.g., '20%')" },

        "minerals": "Comma-separated list of minerals with amounts and %DV (e.g., 'Calcium: 100 mg, Iron: 2 mg')"
    },
    "dietary_fiber": { "amount": "Fiber amount in grams (e.g., '4 g')", "percent_dv": "Percent Daily Value (e.g., '16%')" },

    4)Ensure the JSON format is clean, machine-readable, and consistent for easy data parsing and graph plotting.
    5)Avoid creating a JSON structure for non-food-related inputs, and always return the "error" key in such cases.
